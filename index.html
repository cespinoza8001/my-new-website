    <h1 class="header">Christian's Top 3 Games</h1>
    <h2>Bio:</h2>
        <p>Before we get into my top 3 games, I just want to give a brief bio about myself.</p> 
        <p>I have been playing games for as long as I remember so it's safe to say that I am a pretty big nerd when it comes to gaming.</p>
        <p>I love to play anything from fps, to horror games, to RPG's, to MMO's. Basically if it's a good game, I'm willing to give it a try.</p> 
        <p>I also occasionally stream on twitch and create youtube videos of my gameplay. So with that being said lets get into my current top 3 games. </p>

        <p class="Tarkov">and a story-driven walkthrough. With each passing day the situation in the Norvinsk region grows more and</p>
        <p class="Tarkov">more complicated. Incessant warfare in Tarkov has sparked massive panic; the local population has fled</p>
        <p class="Tarkov">the city, but those who stayed are looking to improve their fortunes at the expense of others. Having accepted</p>   
        <p class="Tarkov">the new reality, savage Tarkov locals - "Scavs" flocked into well-armed gangs and started the redivision of the city.</p>
        <p class="Tarkov">Nowadays, Tarkov is separated by unseen borders, controlled by different groups. Gain-greedy gunmen</p>
        <p class="Tarkov">would go to any length to have their way, including the murder of civilians and direct confrontation with the</p>
        <p class="Tarkov">two private military companies. The players will have to experience living in the skin of one of the mercenaries</p>
        <p class="Tarkov"> who survived the initial stage of the Tarkov conflict. After choosing one of the sides – USEC or BEAR –</p>    
        <p class="Tarkov">the player’s character starts to make his way out of the city. Tarkov is sealed off by UN and Russian military,</p>    
        <p class="Tarkov">supply chains are cut, communication with operational command is lost, and in these conditions everyone has to make</p>
        <p class="Tarkov"> his own choices of what to do and how to get out of the chaos-ridden metropolis.</p>
