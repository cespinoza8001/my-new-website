    <h2>Bio:</h2>
        <p>Before we get into my top 5 games, I just want to give a brief bio about myself.</p> 
        <p>I have been playing games for as long as I remember so it's safe to say that I am a pretty big nerd when it comes to gaming.</p>
        <p>I love to play anything from fps, to horror games, to RPG's, to MMO's. Basically if it's a good game, I'm willing to give it a try.</p> 
        <p>I also occasionally stream on twitch and create youtube videos of my gameplay. So with that being said lets get into my current top 5 games. </p>
